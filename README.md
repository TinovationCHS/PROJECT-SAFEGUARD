# PROJECT-SAFEGUARD
A home security app created collectively by High Schoolers in the Tinovation programming club. Students come to meetings, follow a workshop presented to them, and over the course of 1-2 hours learn a specific concept and create a proof of aforementioned concept. These proofs of concept were then collected by club officers and manually aggregated into one cohesive, codebase. This codebase was then cleaned up and streamlined into a functional cross-platform application that is essentially created by every single member of the club.
